## BAQUI Advisory – Digital Family Office Website

This folder contains a simple, static marketing site for **BAQUI Advisory**, a digital family office focused on private wealth management and multi‑generational wealth planning.

### Files

- `index.html` – Main one‑page website with sections for hero, services, approach, families, insights, and contact.
- `style.css` – All visual styling (layout, typography, colors, responsive rules).
- `assest/` – Reserved folder for local images or other static assets if you want to replace the default remote photography.

### How to open the site

1. On your Mac, open **Finder** and go to:  
   `/Users/mayoadee/Desktop/BaQui Advisory`
2. Double‑click `index.html` to open it in your default browser (Safari, Chrome, etc.).

The page is fully static and does **not** require any server or build step.

### Customization tips

- Replace the background photos by editing the image URLs in `style.css` (search for `pexels` URLs).
- Update copy (headlines, bullet points, sections) directly inside `index.html`.
- To integrate your real BAQUI logo, add the image file into `assest/` and swap the `.brand-mark` CSS for a `background-image` or `<img>` tag in the header.
